## Description

This is a salary calculator to let HR know when their monthly costs are excessive. This is done by accepting inputs and putting them in an array, and then displaying the array. It accepts inputs (but requires that all inputs are filled, names may not include numbers, id numbers must be 4 digits, and ID numbers may not already be in use). When a line is deleted, the same employee is also removed from the array of employees, and this updates the current monthly costs. Currently it automatically corrects the case of employee names and jobs.
