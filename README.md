# jQuery Salary Calculator

## Description

_Duration: 6 hours_

This is a salary calculator to let HR know when their monthly costs are excessive. This is done by accepting inputs and putting them in an array, and then displaying the array. It accepts inputs (but requires that all inputs are filled, names may not include numbers, id numbers must be 4 digits, and ID numbers may not already be in use). When a line is deleted, the same employee is also removed from the array of employees, and this updates the current monthly costs. Currently it automatically corrects the case of employee names and jobs. The intent of this page is to practice using jquery and getting information back from the DOM (which is why it does not use ids on the delete buttons to know which employee to delete).
